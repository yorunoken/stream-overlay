2. Set up webhook integration:

    - Go to your Buy Me a Coffee dashboard

    ngrok http 4000
    ```
    Then use the generated URL as your webhook endpoint.

```json
{
    "type": "payment.created",
    "data": {
        "amount": 5,
        "supporter_name": "Donor Name",
        "support_note": "Optional message",

}
```

All donations are stored persistently and accessible via the API.
